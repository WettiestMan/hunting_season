This seems to be an attempt of using Kanban methodology

things to do:

- Maybe how to rotate a sprite to indicate position?
- Maybe an intro
- Do you really like the project's name?

things in progress (3 max):

- The art
- Points and record
- Game over

should I test?

- Define my entities (IGameEntity(an interface), Background, Crosshair, Duck, DuckGenerator, PointDisplayer, Sounds, Game(an application class with program scope members). Less important: AmmoPack, AmmoPackGenerator, AmmoDisplayer)
- Ducks and their movement
- Hit detection

finished!!!

- Learn how to load textures
